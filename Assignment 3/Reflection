Based on the industrial talk, I have learned that we have to be brave to communicate with others as we have to ask about the problem that we had and if we need some guide,don’t shy to ask the supervisor or manager to teach us something that we didn’t know.
We also have to built a good relationship with our colleagues as we want to build the trust in our team and enhance the relationship so that it will produce a more cohesive team.
Then,I also realized that if I want to be a system developer,I have many obstacles that I have to go through.
I also have to work on myself to be more proactive in communication and also have to be calm when I’m going through some problems.
We also have to be professional and not lead the project with our emotion conquer ourself,we have to have a clear mind and open mind to solve the problem with our team.
The teamwork is important so that’s why we have to built a strong trust and understanding in the team.
