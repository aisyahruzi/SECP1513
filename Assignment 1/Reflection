to think outside the box in while trying to solve new problem.Futhermore , being punctual shows that us being serious while dealing with anything

My Own Reflection: I learned that we must have a variety of skills either soft skills or learning skills. 
If we want to grasp a lot of a job opportunity, we need to have a many skills and more qualifications for that job.
We also need to communicate if we want to survive a work life , with the help of colleagues and supervisor or senior manager,we can do the task more easier as we can asked how and learn more about the task.
The work given also have to submit it earlier than the due date.In conclusion,there's many soft skills and other skills that we need for the work life and also we also need to enjoy what do we do as it will make our work life more easier.
