The PC Assemble session makes me realize that I didnt know about the components in the PCU at all. I'm glad I know how to assemble and diassemble the component in the coreect place due to the session.The tiniest mistake can makes the PCU can't on at all.
The components have their own functions and have their sensitivity so it must be handled carefully.During this session also, I realize that it takes a long time to install the components if the group didnt have any cooperation.So,being cooperative makes the work easier and less mistake.
